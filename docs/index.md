  Manage Docker-hosted resources (such as repositories,

  [!WARNING]This project is not for managing objects in a local docker engine. If you would like to use Terraform to interact with a docker engine, kreuzwerker/docker is a fine provider.
  Usage
  Below is a basic example of how to use the Docker services Terraform provider to create a Docker repository.
  
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      docker = {
        source  = "docker/docker"
        version = "~> 0.2"
      }
    }
  }
  
  provider "docker" { }

    name        = "example-repo"
    description = "This is an example Docker repository"
    private     = true
  }
  
  Authentication
  We have multiple ways to set your Docker credentials.
  Setting credentials
  Use docker login to log in to aregistry https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/. The docker CLI
  will store your credentials securely in your credential store, such as the
  operating system native keychain. The Docker Terraform provider will
  use these credentials automatically.
  
  cat ~/my_password.txt | docker login --username my-username --password-stdin
  
  If you'd like to use a different account for running the provider,
  you can set credentials in the environment:
  
  export DOCKER_USERNAME=my-username
  export DOCKER_PASSWORD=my-secret-token
  terraform plan ...
  
  Credential types
  You can create a personal access token (PAT) to use as an alternative to your
  password for Docker CLI authentication.
  A "Read, Write, & Delete" PAT can be used to create, edit, and
  manage permissions for Docker Hub repositories.
  The advantage of PATs is that they have many securitybenefits https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/ over

# docker Provider

Manage Docker-hosted resources (such as repositories,
teams, organization settings, and more) using Terraform.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **not** for managing objects in a local docker engine. If you would like to use Terraform to interact with a docker engine, [kreuzwerker/docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest) is a fine provider.

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the Docker services Terraform provider to create a Docker repository.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "docker/docker"
      version = "~> 0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" { }

resource "docker_repository" "example" {
  name        = "example-repo"
  description = "This is an example Docker repository"
  private     = true
}
```


## Authentication

We have multiple ways to set your Docker credentials.

### Setting credentials

Use `docker login` to [log in to a
registry](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/). The `docker` CLI
will store your credentials securely in your credential store, such as the
operating system native keychain. The Docker Terraform provider will
use these credentials automatically.

```
cat ~/my_password.txt | docker login --username my-username --password-stdin
```

If you'd like to use a different account for running the provider,
you can set credentials in the environment:

```
export DOCKER_USERNAME=my-username
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=my-secret-token
terraform plan ...
```

### Credential types

You can create a personal access token (PAT) to use as an alternative to your
password for Docker CLI authentication.

A "Read, Write, & Delete" PAT can be used to create, edit, and
manage permissions for Docker Hub repositories.

The advantage of PATs is that they have [many security
benefits](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/) over
passwords.

Unfortunately, PATs are limited to managing repositories. If you'd like to use
this provider to manage organizations and teams, you will need to authenticate
