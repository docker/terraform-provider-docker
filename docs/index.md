  [!WARNING]This project is not for managing objects in a local docker engine. If you would like to use Terraform to interact with a docker engine, kreuzwerker/docker is a fine provider.
  Usage
  Below is a basic example of how to use the Docker services Terraform provider to create a Docker repository.
  
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      docker = {
        source  = "docker/docker"
        version = "~> 0.2"
      }
    }
  }
  
  provider "docker" { }
  
  resource "docker_repository" "example" {
    name        = "example-repo"
    description = "This is an example Docker repository"
    private     = true
  }
  
  Authentication
  We have multiple ways to set your Docker credentials.
  Setting credentials with docker login
  To login in an interactive command-line:
  
  docker login
  
  To login in a non-interactive script:
  
  cat ~/my_password.txt | docker login --username my-username --password-stdin
  
  The docker CLI
  will store your credentials securely in your credential store, such as the
  operating system native keychain. The Docker Terraform provider will
  use these credentials automatically.
  Setting credentials in CI
  The Docker Terraform provider will work with your CI provider's
  native Docker login action. For example, in GitHub Actions https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login:
  
  jobs:
    login:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Login to Docker Hub
          uses: docker/login-action@v3
          with:
            username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
  
  Setting credentials with environment variables
  If you'd like to use a different account for running the provider,
  you can set credentials in the environment:
  
  export DOCKER_USERNAME=my-username
  export DOCKER_PASSWORD=my-secret-token
  terraform plan ...
  
  Setting credentials in Terraform (NOT RECOMMENDED)
  [!WARNING]Hard-coding secrets in Terraform is risky. You risk leaking the secretsif they're committed to version control.
  Only pass in a password in Terraform if you're pulling the secret from a secure
  location, or if you're doing local testing.
  
  provider "docker" {
    username = "my-username"
    password = "my-secret-token"
  }
  
  Credential types
  You can create a personal access token (PAT) to use as an alternative to your
  password for Docker CLI authentication.
  A "Read, Write, & Delete" PAT can be used to create, edit, and
  manage permissions for Docker Hub repositories.
  The advantage of PATs is that they have many securitybenefits https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/ over
  passwords.

# docker Provider

Manage Docker-hosted resources (such as repositories,
teams, organization settings, and more) using Terraform.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **not** for managing objects in a local docker engine. If you would like to use Terraform to interact with a docker engine, [kreuzwerker/docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest) is a fine provider.

## Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use the Docker services Terraform provider to create a Docker repository.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "docker/docker"
      version = "~> 0.2"
    }
  }
}

provider "docker" { }

resource "docker_repository" "example" {
  name        = "example-repo"
  description = "This is an example Docker repository"
  private     = true
}
```


## Authentication

We have multiple ways to set your Docker credentials.

### Setting credentials with `docker login`

To login in an interactive command-line:

```
docker login
```

To login in a non-interactive script:

```
cat ~/my_password.txt | docker login --username my-username --password-stdin
```

The `docker` CLI
will store your credentials securely in your credential store, such as the
operating system native keychain. The Docker Terraform provider will
use these credentials automatically.

### Setting credentials in CI

The Docker Terraform provider will work with your CI provider's
native Docker login action. For example, in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login):

```
jobs:
  login:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Setting credentials with environment variables

If you'd like to use a different account for running the provider,
you can set credentials in the environment:

```
export DOCKER_USERNAME=my-username
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=my-secret-token
terraform plan ...
```

### Setting credentials in Terraform (NOT RECOMMENDED)

> [!WARNING]
> Hard-coding secrets in Terraform is risky. You risk leaking the secrets
> if they're committed to version control.

Only pass in a password in Terraform if you're pulling the secret from a secure
location, or if you're doing local testing.

```hcl
provider "docker" {
  username = "my-username"
  password = "my-secret-token"
}
```

### Credential types

You can create a personal access token (PAT) to use as an alternative to your
password for Docker CLI authentication.

A "Read, Write, & Delete" PAT can be used to create, edit, and
manage permissions for Docker Hub repositories.

The advantage of PATs is that they have [many security
benefits](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/) over
passwords.

Unfortunately, PATs are limited to managing repositories. If you'd like to use
this provider to manage organizations and teams, you will need to authenticate
